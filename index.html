										<h2>About the Author</h2>
										<p>Samuel Taylor Coleridge</p>
									</header>
									<p>
										Coleridge was impulsive, erring, warm- hearted. Coleridge had magnificent plans and dreams ; he was indo-lent, 
										and, falling into the terrible habit of opium, he struggled like a drowning man against the fate which seemed 
										to have, overtaken him ; he left great works incomplete, scarcely begun, indeed ; he married in haste and repented 
										at leisure ; he submitted to be helped by his friends, but he gave lavishly of the best he had to his friends, 
										and no one can read his painful biography without seeing that he so impressed himself successively on one after 
										another, as never to want the sympathy and loving help which should carry him over difficulties.
									</p>
									<p>
										He was born at the vicarage of Ottery St. Mary, in Dev- 
										onshire, England, October 21, 1772. His father was a 
										clergyman of the Church of England, and a schoolmaster, 
										good-hearted, absent-minded and impractical. The poet 
										was one of a large family, and his childhood was that of a 
										precocious and imaginative boy, who read fairy tales and 
										acted out the scenes in them, living much by himself and in 
										the world which he created out of his dreams. When he 
										was nine years old his father died, and the next year Cole- 
										ridge entered the great public school of Christ's Hospital, 
										where he was a schoolfellow of Charles Lamb. From school 
										he went up to Cambridge, and there he made Wordsworth's 
										acquaintance, but his college life was a I Token and not very 
										satisfactory one. Indeed, at one tim , for reasons not 
										wholly clear, he broke away and enlisted ander an assumed 
										name in a regiment of dragoons. It was an odd jump 
										from the frying-pan into the fire, for he had a violent an- 
										tipathy to soldiers and horses, as he himself confessed, 
										and he was glad when his concealment was discovered and 
										a way was found for the runaway to return to college.

											<h3>About the Poem</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											"How a ship having passed the Line, was driven by 
storms to the cold Country towards the South Pole ; and 
how from thence she made her course to the tropical lati- 
tude of the great Pacific Ocean ; and of the strange things 
that befell ; and in what manner the Ancyent Mariner came 
back to his own Country.'* 

The first suggestion to Coleridge appears to have come 
from a strange dream related to him by a friend, in which 
appeared a skeleton ship with figures in it. Much the 
greatest part of the story was Mr. Coleridge's invention, 
but certain parts Mr. Wordsworth I suggested

											<h3>PART I...</h3>
										</header>
										<p><pre>
It is an ancient Mariner,
And he stoppeth one of three.
'By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,
Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?

The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,
And I am next of kin;
The guests are met, the feast is set:
May'st hear the merry din.'

He holds him with his skinny hand,
'There was a ship,' quoth he.
'Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!'
Eftsoons his hand dropt he.

He holds him with his glittering eye—
The Wedding-Guest stood still,
And listens like a three years' child:
The Mariner hath his will.

The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:
He cannot choose but hear;
And thus spake on that ancient man,
The bright-eyed Mariner.

'The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,
Merrily did we drop
Below the kirk, below the hill,
Below the lighthouse top.

The Sun came up upon the left,
Out of the sea came he!
And he shone bright, and on the right
Went down into the sea.

Higher and higher every day,
Till over the mast at noon—'
The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,
For he heard the loud bassoon.

The bride hath paced into the hall,
Red as a rose is she;
Nodding their heads before her goes
The merry minstrelsy.

The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,
Yet he cannot choose but hear;
And thus spake on that ancient man,
The bright-eyed Mariner.

And now the STORM-BLAST came, and he
Was tyrannous and strong:
He struck with his o'ertaking wings,
And chased us south along.

With sloping masts and dipping prow,
As who pursued with yell and blow
Still treads the shadow of his foe,
And forward bends his head,
The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,
And southward aye we fled.

And now there came both mist and snow,
And it grew wondrous cold:
And ice, mast-high, came floating by,
As green as emerald.

And through the drifts the snowy clifts
Did send a dismal sheen:
Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken—
The ice was all between.

The ice was here, the ice was there,
The ice was all around:
It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,
Like noises in a swound!

At length did cross an Albatross,
Thorough the fog it came;
As if it had been a Christian soul,
We hailed it in God's name.

It ate the food it ne'er had eat,
And round and round it flew.
The ice did split with a thunder-fit;
The helmsman steered us through!

And a good south wind sprung up behind;
The Albatross did follow,
And every day, for food or play,
Came to the mariner's hollo!

In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,
It perched for vespers nine;
Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,
Glimmered the white Moon-shine.'

'God save thee, ancient Mariner!
From the fiends, that plague thee thus!—
Why look'st thou so?'—With my cross-bow
I shot the ALBATROSS.</pre>
